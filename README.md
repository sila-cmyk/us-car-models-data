# US Car Models Data (1992 - 2026)

A comprehensive dataset featuring over **15,000 car models** spanning from 1992 to 2026. An invaluable resource for automotive researchers, industry professionals, data scientists, and car enthusiasts exploring the evolution of American automotive engineering.

## 📢 Important Announcement

**The free version of this dataset will no longer receive updates.** All existing data remains freely available for download and use, but we're transitioning to a paid subscription model for those who need continuously updated data with comprehensive specifications.

### Why We're Making This Change

Since 2018, I've maintained this dataset completely free—supporting startups, companies, and developers worldwide without any sponsorship, funding, or compensation. To continue providing this resource and keep it updated, I need to cover operational costs and sustain the project.

**Here's what you need to know:**
- All existing free data remains available forever
- The paid subscription will be **significantly more affordable** than competing services
- You'll get access to up-to-date information with extensive specifications
